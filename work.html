  <h2>Associate Gameplay Programmer</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://survios.com/">Survios</a></h3>
  <h4>Feb. 2020 - June 2020</h4>
  <p>Recruited for additional engineering support on an upcoming VR title built
  in Unreal Engine 4.
  </p><hr>

  <h2>Junior Software Engineer</h2>
  <h3><a href="http://skydance.com/interactive/">Skydance Interactive</a></h3>
  <h4>Sept. 2018 - Jan. 2020</h4>
  <p>Beginning as an engineer intern in July, I was brought on full-time to
  continue my work on
  <a href=https://vrwalkingdead.com/>The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners</a>,
  an action-adventure VR title built in Unreal Engine 4.

  <h2>C and Assembly Programming TA</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://ecs.vancouver.wsu.edu/">WSU Vancouver</a></h3>
  <h4>Spring 2017</h4>
  <p>As a grader, I was responsible for validating output of students' programs,
  and manually reviewing their code printouts to provide feedback on
  correctness, conceptual understanding, and style.
  </p><hr>

  <h2>Research Assistant - Twitter Project</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://ecs.vancouver.wsu.edu/">WSU Vancouver</a></h3>
  <h4>Summer 2016</h4>
  <p>I performed exploratory statistical analysis on a large dataset of tweets
  using Python, pandas, and Hadoop MapReduce jobs. My main task was to write
  reusable scripts to compare word frequencies over time between tweets with
  and without a specified hashtag, and format their combined output for easy
  visualization using Matplotlib.

  <h2>Junior 2D Game Design TA</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://academy.digipen.edu/">DigiPen ProjectFUN</a></h3>
  <h4>Summer 2013</h4>
  <p>I supervised and assisted in instruction for a summer workshop on game
  design and development to a class of about thirty 4th to 7th grade students.
  The goal of the course was for each student to build a simple game using one
  of DigiPen's proprietary C++ frameworks.</p><p>
  The majority of the students had no prior experience programming, so along
  with coordinating lesson plans with the primary instructor and other
  assistants, I was responsible for actively reviewing students' work to ensure
  that they would successfully reach milestones for their projects.
