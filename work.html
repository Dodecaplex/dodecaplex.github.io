    <h2>C and Assembly Programming TA</h2>
    <h3>WSU Vancouver, Spring 2017</h3>
  <p>As a grader, I was responsible for validating output of students' programs,
  and manually reviewing their code printouts to provide feedback on correctness,
  conceptual understanding, and style.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Assistant - Twitter Project</h2>
  <h3>WSU Vancouver, Summer 2016</h3>
  <p>I performed exploratory statistical analysis on a large dataset of tweets
  using Python, pandas, and Hadoop MapReduce jobs. My main task was to write
  reusable scripts to compare word frequencies over time between tweets with
  and without a specified hashtag, and format their combined output for easy
  visualization using Matplotlib.

  <h2>Junior 2D Game Design TA (DigiPen ProjectFUN, Summer 2013)</h2>
  <h3>DigiPenProjectFUN, Summer 2013</h3>
  <p>I supervised and assisted in instruction for a summer workshop on game design
  and development to a class of about thirty 4th to 7th grade students. The goal
  of the course was for each student to build a simple game using one of DigiPen's
  proprietary C++ frameworks.<br><br>
  The majority of the students had no prior experience programming, so along with
  coordinating lesson plans with the primary instructor and other assistants, I
  was responsible for actively reviewing students' work to ensure that they would
  successfully reach milestones for their projects.
